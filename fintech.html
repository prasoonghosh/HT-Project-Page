                                    <p><span>The term “fintech company” describes any business that uses technology to modify, enhance, or automate financial services for businesses or consumers. Some examples include mobile banking, peer-to-peer payment services (e.g., Venmo, CashApp), automated portfolio managers (e.g., Wealth front, Betterment), or trading platforms such as Robinhood. It can also apply to the development and trading of cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ether).</span></p>
                                        <p><span class="title-s"><u>History of FinTech</u></span></p>
                                        <p><span>Despite the fact that fintech seems like relatively recent development in technological advances, the underlying concept has existed for quite some time. It is generally considered that early credit cards in the 1950s were the first fintech products to become available to the general public, as they eliminated the need for consumers to carry physical currency. Fintech evolved from there to include bank mainframes and online stock trading services. PayPal was one of the first fintech companies to be founded in 1998, operating primarily on the internet. Mobile technology, social media, and encryption have also further revolutionized the business model. We rely on these mobile payment apps, blockchain networks, and social media-based payment options because of this fintech revolution.</span></p>

                            <p><span>Digital disruption is completely changing the rules of business, and companies that don't stay on top will find it difficult to catch up with more agile competitors. Intel describes this state of extreme disruption in business as the Vortex of Change, where new technologies are transforming companies across every industry, from healthcare to entertainment to transportation and manufacturing.</span></p>
                            <p><span>Jim Henrys, Director of Business Solutions at Intel explains why technology is disrupting multinational monopolies: "The democratization of technology is the key driver of disruption. Cloud and mobile technologies have already turned business models upside down and given start-ups the power to disrupt entire industries, regardless of their size, but further unprecedented technological change is just around the corner – so this really is still early days”.</span></p>
                            <p><span>In addition to being unable to innovate, organizations operating on outdated hardware waste unnecessary resources. "In a world where everything is changing and connecting, the biggest mistake to make today is to think you'll be on top indefinitely and stand still,” warns Henrys. Not only must businesses update their IT infrastructure, but they must also develop completely new business models and Triple Bottom Line (TBL) strategies that will enable them to flourish in the digital landscape.</span></p>
                            <p><span>Business success is measured in terms of three elements: economic, environmental, and social. While money is inevitably the driving force, being socially and environmentally responsible is vital to any business's bottom line in the digital age. In addition, businesses need to revamp their workplaces in order to foster a productive workplace culture and provide employees with smart work methods.</span></p>
                            <p><span>“Many organizations fool themselves into thinking they foster creativity and innovation across their workforce,” says Andrew Moore, GM of the Digital Transformation Office at Intel. “In reality, employees are often hesitant to come forward with ideas at most of the largest corporations in the world. Usually, it’s because they know senior leaders won’t take on board concepts unless they’re backed up with a fully polished presentation and a detailed ROI calculation. This leads to companies being overtaken by agile competitors who aren’t afraid of taking risks and trying radical things.”</span></p>
                            <p><span>A business must ensure it is the disruptor instead of being the disruptor in order to stay competitive. The Financial Services Industry (FSI) has adapted slowly to innovative technologies, while many sectors have already been transformed by them. As innovation continues to accelerate, the financial sector has a lot of catching up to do, hampered by antiquated infrastructure and more stringent regulations than most other sectors.</span></p>
                            <p><span>According to Gerald Grattoni, Head of EMEA Financial Services Industry Solutions at Intel Corporation, three key topics must be addressed by FSI businesses to ensure success in the digital age:</span></p>

                                All businesses in the digital era must deal with the issue of cyber security. To maintain consumer trust, banks need to assure them that their financial and personal information is secure. Security of customer data will be enhanced by new systems such as multi-factor authentication.

                                “Customers are now a lot more tech-savvy and have different expectations on how they experience their financial services, putting pressure on banks to adopt,” says Grattoni. Along with the expectation for consistent experiences across devices, there is also a demand for real-time digital payments, both of which require the underlying technology to be updated. In particular, younger generations expect the same convenience that they get from other non-finance platforms such as Netflix*, Spotify* and Facebook*. As such, customer empathy is absolutely vital.

Compliance will continue to evolve as emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence enable banks to make more effective use of big data.
