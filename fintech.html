                                    <p><span>The term “fintech company” describes any business that uses technology to modify, enhance, or automate financial services for businesses or consumers. Some examples include mobile banking, peer-to-peer payment services (e.g., Venmo, CashApp), automated portfolio managers (e.g., Wealth front, Betterment), or trading platforms such as Robinhood. It can also apply to the development and trading of cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ether).</span></p>
                                        <p><span class="title-s"><u>History of FinTech</u></span></p>
                                        <p><span>Despite the fact that fintech seems like relatively recent development in technological advances, the underlying concept has existed for quite some time. It is generally considered that early credit cards in the 1950s were the first fintech products to become available to the general public, as they eliminated the need for consumers to carry physical currency. Fintech evolved from there to include bank mainframes and online stock trading services. PayPal was one of the first fintech companies to be founded in 1998, operating primarily on the internet. Mobile technology, social media, and encryption have also further revolutionized the business model. We rely on these mobile payment apps, blockchain networks, and social media-based payment options because of this fintech revolution.</span></p>

                            <p><span>Digital disruption is completely changing the rules of business, and companies that don't stay on top will find it difficult to catch up with more agile competitors. Intel describes this state of extreme disruption in business as the Vortex of Change, where new technologies are transforming companies across every industry, from healthcare to entertainment to transportation and manufacturing.</span></p>
                            <p><span>Jim Henrys, Director of Business Solutions at Intel explains why technology is disrupting multinational monopolies: "The democratization of technology is the key driver of disruption. Cloud and mobile technologies have already turned business models upside down and given start-ups the power to disrupt entire industries, regardless of their size, but further unprecedented technological change is just around the corner – so this really is still early days”.</span></p>
                            <p><span>In addition to being unable to innovate, organizations operating on outdated hardware waste unnecessary resources. "In a world where everything is changing and connecting, the biggest mistake to make today is to think you'll be on top indefinitely and stand still,” warns Henrys. Not only must businesses update their IT infrastructure, but they must also develop completely new business models and Triple Bottom Line (TBL) strategies that will enable them to flourish in the digital landscape.</span></p>
                            <p><span>Business success is measured in terms of three elements: economic, environmental, and social. While money is inevitably the driving force, being socially and environmentally responsible is vital to any business's bottom line in the digital age. In addition, businesses need to revamp their workplaces in order to foster a productive workplace culture and provide employees with smart work methods.</span></p>
                            <p><span>“Many organizations fool themselves into thinking they foster creativity and innovation across their workforce,” says Andrew Moore, GM of the Digital Transformation Office at Intel. “In reality, employees are often hesitant to come forward with ideas at most of the largest corporations in the world. Usually, it’s because they know senior leaders won’t take on board concepts unless they’re backed up with a fully polished presentation and a detailed ROI calculation. This leads to companies being overtaken by agile competitors who aren’t afraid of taking risks and trying radical things.”</span></p>
                            <p><span>A business must ensure it is the disruptor instead of being the disruptor in order to stay competitive. The Financial Services Industry (FSI) has adapted slowly to innovative technologies, while many sectors have already been transformed by them. As innovation continues to accelerate, the financial sector has a lot of catching up to do, hampered by antiquated infrastructure and more stringent regulations than most other sectors.</span></p>
                            <p><span>According to Gerald Grattoni, Head of EMEA Financial Services Industry Solutions at Intel Corporation, three key topics must be addressed by FSI businesses to ensure success in the digital age:</span></p>

                                All businesses in the digital era must deal with the issue of cyber security. To maintain consumer trust, banks need to assure them that their financial and personal information is secure.

                                “Customers are now a lot more tech-savvy and have different expectations on how they experience their financial services, putting pressure on banks to adopt,” says Grattoni. Along with the expectation for consistent experiences across devices, there is also a demand for real-time digital payments, both of which require the underlying technology to be updated. In particular, younger generations expect the same convenience that they get from other non-finance platforms such as Netflix*, Spotify* and Facebook*. As such, customer empathy is absolutely vital.

                <p><span>Looking forward, it will be crucial to consider how emerging technologies – such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and IoT – will manipulate the landscape and inspire new business models. “You can see early deployments of some of these technologies already but we’re looking at them becoming more mainstream in the next few years,” says Grattoni. In contrast to relatively 'new' sectors, like online retail and social media, banks have been slow in utilizing the valuable data they possess.
Machine learning and artificial intelligence should be integral parts of any forward-looking digital business strategy. Not only do they streamline operations and remove inefficiencies from the payment process, but they can also vastly improve customer interfaces and personalization. “Three things have come together – the emergence of big data, the evolution of drastically improved hardware, and smarter algorithms. When you plug these three together, it’s a dream recipe for the acceleration of AI,” says Grattoni.
</span></p></span>
                <p><span>Intel has already showcased a number of developments in this area, including the Movidius Myriad X Unit (VPU) Vision Processing, Intel RealSense technology, which integrates 'human-like senses' into devices, and self-learning neuromorphic chip called Loihi, which mimics the brain's functions.</span></p>
                <p><span class="title-s"><u>What will the future look like?</u></span>
                <p><span>In more than a decade, emerging technologies will completely transform the financial services industry. As more decisions are made by machines, trust will reach a tipping point as AI and machine learning become integral to FSI businesses. Customers would be able to interact with technology in a much more natural way with AI and robotics advances. Blockchain, which forms the foundation of Bitcoin, will also benefit the finance sector of the future.</span></p>
                <p><span>In short, a shared ledger is a database that records ownership and provides a permanent record of transactions. It is not needed for the ledger to be overseen by a central authority, as it is validated by the network itself. A shared ledger's audit trail will revolutionize several areas within FSI, including fraud detection and tax collection.</span></p>
                <p><span>Furthermore, banks will no longer resemble what they are today. Banks will no longer resemble what they are today. Grattoni states that the fortress looks safe, and fortified and that the inside is pretty dull and there isn't much activity there. That was his understanding until he stumbled upon an unusual branch of a Boston bank. Several people were seated at tables with laptops, a barista was serving coffee and the television played sports. The concept of a dying branch had been turned upside down, he explains. It is important to improve the customer experience, and it is possible to do that.</span></p>
                <p><span>There are two possible directions for banks from 2030 onwards, says Grattoni, who believes that they could either become core transaction platforms or fully-featured lifestyle companies. “In the first example, banks lose their customer-facing infrastructure, including branches, websites, apps and sales staff, to become infrastructure providers, concentrating on transactional services, capital financing and loans, and handling all aspects of regulation and compliance,” explains Grattoni. “They will then let other consumer-focused companies connect to this service to provide a user-focused front end”. Organizations can provide financial products as part of their regular business models, or even offer them to employees as benefits. However, this model will require open-source, modular technology with open standards to be successful.</span></p>
                <p><span>“The alternative route is the complete opposite. It sees banks embracing the data they do have to gain better insight into their customers than even the most data-savvy web company can,” says Grattoni. “Arguably, the transactional data that banks hold gives more of an insight into a customer’s habits than their online activity.”</span></p>
                <p><span>Another possibility that could happen as part of either of these two scenarios is the bank as a central data custodian. As know-your-customer (KYC) initiatives evolve to become almost 100% accurate, banks could potentially become responsible for a person’s core data profile, which is then shared with the government and other organizations. For this to become a reality, data security needs to be the top priority.</span></p>
                <p><span>The leveling of capital markets is another potential scenario for the future of finance. With connected devices and readily available market data set to level out the asymmetric playing field of financial information, investment banks may no longer be at such an advantage. What’s more, AI will lower the risk, and therefore the return, on investments by making decisions based on predictive analytics.</span></p>
                <p><span>In conclusion, the financial sector has been slow to adapt to the digital landscape, but is set to undergo an unprecedented change in the coming years – and FSI businesses must be ready. Organizations will need to update legacy infrastructure and move towards multi-cloud technology that allows agile, forward-thinking business models. Companies must look ahead to 2030 today and consider the 8 questions that all businesses need to answer for a successful digital transformation. “The reality is that people are struggling to address decisions that were taken 30 years ago. In your 2030 strategies, the decisions you make now are absolutely vital,” warns Grattoni.</span></p>

                                    It is widely considered that information technology is very useful for financial services. Digital technology is used by numerous financial organizations every day, from the exchange of financial tools to the estimation of earnings.

                                    Modern financial services mainly focus on providing faster, more organized customer experiences online. Many people prefer to use mobile applications in today's fast-paced world.

                            20 years ago, this option of paying bills through a mobile device did not exist. Information technology is a crucial component of financial services in many ways. Companies can also update at the same rate as their competitors with the aid of technology.
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead">With the help of information technology, social media can provide valuable data on their consumers. The organizations can increase their brand credibility and gather data by integrating online communities with their products.</p>
                        <p class="lead">Using IT eliminates the need to use checks to transfer financial information. The internet detects a person’s bank account balance by credit or debit card purchase and swiftly rejects a transaction if there is no sufficient money. The staff in a traditional bank usually don’t work on weekends. In contrast, the internet does not know the concept of holidays, so the consumer can initiate a transaction from the comfort of his own home at any time.</p>
                        <p class="lead">Internet banking has revolutionized the finance industry with mobile payment applications like Paytm, phonepe and Google Pay. Several financial companies have stepped up their security game, to reduce the risks posed by the internet.</p>
