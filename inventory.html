In other words, the chain of events begins with the purchase and ends with the point of sale at a retail store. </p>
                    <p class="lead">Stock in the warehouse must be monitored as well as stock coming in and going out. Your company's inventory can be tracked using inventory control, including which products are available and where they are located within the warehouse. </p>
                    <p class="lead">To minimize the costs associated with holding onto the stock, it is necessary to reduce the stock holding period. Additionally, you'll understand when to purchase new products, replenish stock, and sell old stock. In addition to reducing warehouse space and adding to your cash flow, inventory management techniques can ensure you're not holding onto the old or unsellable stock. </p>

                                    An employee fills out a purchase requisition form to request that certain goods or services be supplied by the purchasing department. The form specifies what items must be acquired and when they are needed, as well as the nature and quantity. To indicate that the purchase requisitions have been authorized, some organizations require that their department manager sign the requisitions created by his staff. A company can avoid making unnecessary purchases by following this procedure. Once the form is completed, it is sent to the purchasing department, which obtains the requested items by using a purchase order, which is a legally binding document that is sent to the applicable supplier.

                            Ordering raw materials for production does not require purchase requisitions. Rather, these items are authorized for purchase by a materials management system, which determines the net quantity required by comparing production schedules with on-hand quantities. In order to increase production efficiency, a production system needs to be more automated than departmental purchasing that is typically routed through purchase requisitions.

                        <p class="lead">The issuance of a purchase order does not constitute a contract. A contract between the buyer and seller is formed when the seller accepts the order.  </p>
                        <p class="lead">There are various reasons why companies use Purchase Orders (PO). Buyers and sellers can communicate openly and clearly with purchase orders for maintaining transparency. Additionally, they can help purchasing agents to manage pending orders and incoming orders. A PO also protects sellers if a buyer refuses to pay for goods or services.</p>
                        <p class="lead">The advantage of purchase orders is that they streamline the purchasing process in a standardized manner. On the basis of purchase orders, commercial lenders or financial institutions may provide financial assistance. Nearly every financial institution offers businesspeople a variety of trade finance facilities against purchase orders, including:

It is also possible for companies to make a single purchase and to maximize purchasing by optimizing negotiated conditions or by utilizing existing resources to the fullest extent.</p>

                        <p class="s-description">Quotes are also often referred to as quotations. A proposal is a submission a supplier makes to a potential customer outlining the proposed price for the supplier's products or services. Normal conditions stipulated by the client govern the creation of the quotation.</p>
                        <p class="s-description">In general, there would be no need to provide a quotation if the supplier had fixed rates. Quotations are often required for services but are also required by companies that sell goods.</p>
                        <p class="s-description">Suppliers commit to the price proposed in their quotations to potential clients. An estimate isn't binding on the supplier, so a quotation is very different from one. In order to be profitable, the quotation should take into account all costs associated with the job and be based on markup.
                        </p>
                        <p class="s-description">Quotations typically contain a lot of detail. Taxes/VAT, material costs, labor costs, and other factors affecting the quotation will be outlined in the quotation. Also included is the delivery date of goods or the completion date of the service.</p>
                        <p class="s-description">As well as the timeframe during which a quotation will be valid (after that period has expired, a new quotation will be needed), quotations may also clarify whether a price has changed due to adjustments or modifications to the original invoice.</p>

                        <p class="s-description">Goods Received Notes (GRNs) serve as formal acknowledgments of the receipt of client goods. This document is also known as a delivery note, which proves that goods have already been delivered to the customers. The GRN is also used by suppliers and customers to compare order and delivery quantities.</p>
                        <p class="s-description">GRN will later be attached to the invoice and sent to the customer. Clearly proving the delivery of goods is demonstrated by this piece of evidence. The document is also used by customers for inventory and account payables, as invoices can arrive late and they need to keep track of stock.</p>
                        <p class="s-description">Internally, the document serves as an inventory list. It is possible for goods to be transferred from a factory to several different warehouses throughout the country. It is necessary to move construction materials from the warehouse to the construction site. As a means of preventing fraud or errors, we use the goods received in the note. Transfers of inventory between locations are tracked by accounting departments.
                        </p>
                        <p class="s-description">A good received note has some problems because it is a human-made document. When errors occur, they will impact the other's work depending on how serious they are. The document should be double-checked by another person to prevent human error. Despite the fact that it won't be able to eliminate errors completely, it will be able to reduce them.</p>

                            <p class="s-description">A GR/IR (goods-receipt/invoice-receipt) clearing account is a bookkeeping device that can be used when goods arrive before the invoice is generated, or when an invoice arrives before the goods are delivered.</p>
                            <p class="s-description">In the normal course of business, discrepancies often (if not usually) exist between goods receipt and quantity invoiced for a purchase order. These differences produce an artificial debit or credit balance. The GR/IR clearing account checks the number of goods received against the number of goods invoiced and then posts a positive or negative balance accordingly. The GR/IR clearing account thereby serves as a "buffer" between the inventory account and the vendor account, minimizing confusion and reducing the risk of accounting errors.</p>
                            <p class="s-description">A GR/IR account should be cleared at regular intervals, such as at the end of every fiscal year.

If they match, the supplier’s invoice will be approved for payment. A 3-way match helps decide if an invoice should be paid partly or in full.</p>
