                                    Revenue refers to goods and services sold in the primary operations of a business that generate income. Commercial revenue may also be referred to as sales or as turnover. Interest, royalties, and other fees can be sources of revenue for some companies. Income can be defined as any form of income or it can refer to the amount earned during a specific time frame, as in "Coalition X had revenues of $42 million last year.". Generally, net income is defined as total revenue minus total expenses.

                        <p class="lead">Accountants consider revenue to be a subsection of Equity on the balance sheet, where revenue increases equity. This is due to its position at the very top of the income statement. As opposed to this, the bottom line denotes net income (gross revenues fewer total expenses).</p>
                                <p class="lead">
                                    The term revenue is generally used to refer to the total income a company generates from the sale of goods and services. Revenue from sales of goods or services over time is referred to as sales revenue. Governments receive income from taxpayers in the form of taxes. A charity's fundraising revenue comes from donations and other sources. For the purpose of furthering its social objectives.

                            20 years ago, this option of paying bills through a mobile device did not exist. Information technology is a crucial component of financial services in many ways. Companies can also update at the same rate as their competitors with the aid of technology.
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead">A government or government agency calculates or estimates periodic income according to a particular accounting practice or set of rules. The measurement of revenue differs between cash basis accounting and accrual basis accounting. Generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards are usually required by law for corporations that offer shares for sale to the public.</p>
                        <p class="lead">Using IT eliminates the need to use checks to transfer financial information. The internet detects a person’s bank account balance by credit or debit card purchase and swiftly rejects a transaction if there is no sufficient money. The staff in a traditional bank usually don’t work on weekends. In contrast, the internet does not know the concept of holidays, so the consumer can initiate a transaction from the comfort of his own home at any time.</p>
                        <p class="lead">An income statement summarizes revenue accounts under the heading "Revenue" or "Revenues" under a double-entry accounting system. The revenue account name describes the type of revenue, such as "Repair service revenue", "Rent revenue earned" or "Sales revenue earned".</p>
