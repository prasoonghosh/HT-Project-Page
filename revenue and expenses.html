                                    Revenue refers to goods and services sold in the primary operations of a business that generate income. Commercial revenue may also be referred to as sales or as turnover. Interest, royalties, and other fees can be sources of revenue for some companies. Income can be defined as any form of income or it can refer to the amount earned during a specific time frame, as in "Coalition X had revenues of $42 million last year.". Generally, net income is defined as total revenue minus total expenses.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p class="lead">Accountants consider revenue to be a subsection of Equity on the balance sheet, where revenue increases equity. This is due to its position at the very top of the income statement. As opposed to this, the bottom line denotes net income (gross revenues fewer total expenses).</p>
                                <p class="lead">
                                    The term revenue is generally used to refer to the total income a company generates from the sale of goods and services. Revenue from sales of goods or services over time is referred to as sales revenue. Governments receive income from taxpayers in the form of taxes. A charity's fundraising revenue comes from donations and other sources. For the purpose of furthering its social objectives.

                        <p class="lead">
                            20 years ago, this option of paying bills through a mobile device did not exist. Information technology is a crucial component of financial services in many ways. Companies can also update at the same rate as their competitors with the aid of technology.
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead">A government or government agency calculates or estimates periodic income according to a particular accounting practice or set of rules. The measurement of revenue differs between cash basis accounting and accrual basis accounting. Generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards are usually required by law for corporations that offer shares for sale to the public.</p>
                        <p class="lead">Using IT eliminates the need to use checks to transfer financial information. The internet detects a person’s bank account balance by credit or debit card purchase and swiftly rejects a transaction if there is no sufficient money. The staff in a traditional bank usually don’t work on weekends. In contrast, the internet does not know the concept of holidays, so the consumer can initiate a transaction from the comfort of his own home at any time.</p>
                        <p class="lead">An income statement summarizes revenue accounts under the heading "Revenue" or "Revenues" under a double-entry accounting system. The revenue account name describes the type of revenue, such as "Repair service revenue", "Rent revenue earned" or "Sales revenue earned".</p>

                                        <p class="lead">Expenses are items that require payment of money or fortune to other people or groups to purchase an item, provide a service, or pay for another type of cost. Rent is an expense for a tenant. Education costs for students are an expense for parents. The purchase of food, clothing, furniture, or an automobile is often considered an expense. Expenses are costs that are remitted or paid for in exchange for something of value. An expensive item is one that appears to cost a lot. An inexpensive item is one that appears to cost little. Dinner, refreshments, a feast, etc. are considered "expenses of the table."</p>

                        <p class="lead">A specific cash outflow or other valuable asset from one person or company to another is called an expense in accounting. Generally, the outflow represents one side of a trade between buyers and sellers involving products or services with a similar or better current or future value for the buyer. As a matter of technical terms, an expense is an event that diminishes or depletes a proprietary stake, or entails a liability. The effect of expenses is to reduce equity in an organization. Expenses are defined by the International Accounting Standards Board as follows:</p>
                        <p class="lead"><b>decreases in economic benefits during the accounting period in the form of outflows or depletion of assets or incurrences of liabilities that result in decreases in equity, other than those relating to distributions to equity participants.</b></p>
                        <p class="lead">Expense is also used in sociology, and it refers to the act of sacrificing a particular fortune or price by something or someone to another, often in the context that the latter is taking advantage of the former.</p>

                            Any business is driven by operating revenue. Businesses cannot operate on a day-to-day basis without consistent revenue.</p>
                        <p class="s-description text-center">
                            A measure of operating revenue is usually more valuable than a measure of total revenue. The main reason for this is that it provides important insight into the productivity and profitability of a company's primary operations. A company with steady customer relationships and predictable sales typically have better cash flow than one with a high amount of non-operating revenue.
                        </p>
                        <p class="s-description text-center">Due to the fact that a large percentage of businesses fail because of cash flow problems, businesses need to maintain a consistent operating revenue stream.</p>

                        <p class="s-description text-center">
                            In business, non-operating revenues refer to earnings outside the company's main or central operations. Incidental or peripheral revenues are also considered non-operating revenues. For example, investment income and interest income are common examples. Purchases and sales of merchandise are the retailer's main activities. Its main or central business is not to invest idle cash in interest-bearing investments.
                        </p>
                        <p class="s-description text-center">Gains often result from disposing of property, plant, and equipment at a higher price than the carrying amount (or book value) of the asset. The sale of a delivery truck by a retailer for a cash amount greater than the carrying capacity of the truck is a good example. A lawsuit settlement is another example.</p>
                        <p class="s-description text-center">Revenues and gains from nonoperating activities are usually reported after the subtotal Income from operations on the income statement, with the caption other income.</p>
