                    <p class="s-description text-center">
                        Purchase orders (PO) are commercial documents that indicate the types, quantities, and prices of products or services offered by a buyer to a seller. They are used by organizations to control the purchase of products and services from their suppliers. A purchase order can play an important role in enterprise resource planning.</p>
                    <p class="s-description text-center">
                        The issuance of a purchase order does not constitute a contract. A contract between the buyer and seller is formed when the seller accepts the order.
                    </p>
                    <p class="s-description text-center">There are various reasons why companies use Purchase Orders (PO). Buyers and sellers can communicate openly and clearly with purchase orders for maintaining transparency. Additionally, they can help purchasing agents to manage pending orders and incoming orders. A PO also protects sellers if a buyer refuses to pay for goods or services.</p>
                    <p class="s-description text-center">The advantage of purchase orders is that they streamline the purchasing process in a standardized manner. On the basis of purchase orders, commercial lenders or financial institutions may provide financial assistance. Nearly every financial institution offers businesspeople a variety of trade finance facilities against purchase orders, including:</p>

                        <h2 class="s-title">1) They give you legal protection</h2>
                        <p>Consider a scenario where your startup ordered ten ergonomic chairs and paid for them but on the delivery day only nine arrived. Who's at fault?</p>
                        <p>You can end up in a tricky legal position if you and your vendor disagree without a purchase order. It can sometimes be difficult to prove what went wrong with a purchase without a paper trail.</p>
                        <p>As an on-the-record legal document, purchase orders eliminate ambiguity by binding both parties to a mutually binding contract. A purchase order is legally binding as soon as the vendor receives and approves it.</p>
                        <p>Purchase orders only become legally binding once the vendor "acknowledges" them by signing them. Sending them to a vendor alone isn't enough.</p>

                        <h2 class="s-title">2) They make orders easier to track</h2>
                        <p>Orders can help you track when goods and services arrive, keep track of how you're paying for them, and keep track of how much you're spending. </p>
                        <p>You can track your orders by assigning a PO number to each purchase order, similarly to invoice numbers. Your supplier is contractually bound to deliver orders at a specific time and date, so you can track them more confidently from an operations standpoint. </p>
                        <p>AA contractually-enforced purchase price gives you confidence in your budget from an accounting perspective.</p><br>

                        <h2 class="s-title">3) They help you avoid audit problems</h2>
                        <p>In the event that you get audited, you'll be grateful for creating purchase orders in the first place. Exactly why? Audits are made easier by purchase orders, which provide auditors with a conclusive audit trail and make cross-checking invoices and packing slips easier.</p>
                        <p>Invoices, receipts, and emails with vendors will take a long, painful time to review without purchase orders.</p>

                        <p>A purchase order will speed up the shipping process if your vendor is used to receiving them. All information they need is in one place, so there is no back and forth and no miscommunication.</p>
